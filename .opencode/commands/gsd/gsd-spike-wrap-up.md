<objective>
Curate spike experiment findings and package them into a persistent project skill that OpenCode
auto-loads in future build conversations. Also writes a summary to `.planning/spikes/` for
project history. Output skill goes to `./.claude/skills/spike-findings-[project]/` (project-local).

<process>
Execute the spike-wrap-up workflow from @./.opencode/get-shit-done/workflows/spike-wrap-up.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (auto-include, feature-area grouping, skill synthesis, AGENTS.md routing line, intelligent next-step routing).
